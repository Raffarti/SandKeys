WARNING: This project installs itself quite roughly, it works good for Fedora, install paths are:
/usr/share/SandKeys for Symbol files and Qt4Loader files
/usr/lib64/qt5/qml/ for Qt5 import needed by QmlLoader
/usr/bin/ for sandkeys-qt4 and sandkeys-qt5

plugin and themes are installed by qmake in the default import path.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
Latched modifier will be consumed by any mouse event created through XEvent and XTest
In Qt5 build, mouse focus can be stolen causing a key release event to be lost (e.g. Alt+Tab would result in Tab pressed until clicked again, print screen with ksnapshot (kde)... well... just don't try it at home)
Qt5 rendering is quiet heavy.

Qt4 build is strongly suggested.
